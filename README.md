The name is inspired by everything, an awesome tool to search files in your PC. But the limitation is it can only search for filename. Recently, I am developing a tool to scan the documents in PC to search for some specific kind of data. A idea hits me if I can develop a tool where I can search the content of files. It is the creation of this tool.

I will this tool will perform just like its name!:smirk:
