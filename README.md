# everywhere :mag:
The name is inspired by everything, an awesome tool to search files in your PC. But the limitation is it can only search for filename. Recently, I am developing a tool to scan the documents in PC to search for some specific kind of data. A idea hits me that if I can develop a tool where I can search the content of files. It is the creation of this tool.

I wish this tool will perform just like its name!:smirk:

# Usage
1. Download the tool from [**here**](http://ozfo4jjxb.bkt.clouddn.com/app.zip).
2. Unzip the `app.zip`, and run the `app.exe` in the folder.
3. The client window will show. For the first time, you should click the index button to index files in your PC(The index time depends on the number and size of your files. In my PC, it is about 5 minutes). Then you can serarch everwhere :punch:

# Main features
* Indexed files include: doc, docx, xls, xslx, txt, pdf
* Nearly realtime search after index
* Now, the search supports Chinese and English words. Maybe the search still need optimization.

## Main techniques
* lucene
* javaFX
* POI
